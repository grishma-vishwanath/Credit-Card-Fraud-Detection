# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud is a broad word for theft and fraud perpetrated using or utilizing a credit card at the  moment of payment. As the number of scammers grows every day. Credit cards are used for fraudulent  transactions, and there are several sorts of fraud. As a result, various techniques such as Logistic Regression,  Decision Tree, KNN, and Naive Bayes algorithms are utilized to tackle this problem. To address this issue, machine learning techniques have been used to detect fraud in credit card transactions. In this study, we propose a framework for credit card fraud detection that uses machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions. The proposed framework uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to analyze historical transaction data and identify patterns that indicate fraudulent behavior.

## Objectives
- To identify and foresee the outcome of unauthorised credit card activity.
-  Analyse a few effective machine learning algorithms, identify the one with the best accuracy, and suggest a model.
-  Add a machine learning model to the web-based framework for better user interface and user experience.
-  Find pertinent dataset features that can aid in the detection of fraud. Identify relevant attributes that capture the patterns and traits of fraudulent transactions by extracting and engineering them.
-  Create a system that can process incoming transactions made with credit cards in real-time and identify whether they are counterfeit or genuine using the used machine learning models 

## Proposed Method
In the proposed system here we are proposing some model to detect the fraud activity in credit card transactions. This system is capable of providing most of the essential features required to detect fraudulent and legitimate transactions. As technology changes, it becomes difficult to track the modelling and pattern of fraudulent transactions. With the rise of machine learning, artificial intelligence and other relevant fields of information technology, it becomes feasible to automate this process and to save some of the intensive amount of labour that is put into detecting credit card fraud. To detecting the frauds in credit card system. The comparison is made for different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and naïve Bayes, to determine which algorithm gives suits best and can be adapted by credit card merchants for identifying fraud transactions. Finally, we are integrating our machine learning model with the web based framework using streamlit, it is a web based framework for better user interface and user experience. We are creating menus, inputs fields for prediction, classification reports and display model graph in the web framework

## Conclusiom
In conclusion, credit card fraud is a major concern for financial institutions and customers alike. Machine learning techniques have proven to be effective in detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time. In this study, we proposed a framework for credit card fraud detection that uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to identify patterns that indicate fraudulent behavior. We also integrated the trained machine learning models with a web framework to provide a user-friendly interface for real-time fraud detection. Our experimental results showed that the proposed framework achieved high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. The proposed framework can be deployed in financial institutions to improve their fraud detection capabilities and prevent financial losses due to credit card fraud. Future research can focus on 
further improving the accuracy of the proposed framework and exploring the use of other machine learning techniques to address this problem. The Credit Card Fraud Detection framework using Streamlit and Machine Learning is highly effective in preventing financial losses due to credit card fraud. Future research can focus on improving the framework's efficiency and exploring the use of more advanced machine learning algorithms. The proposed Credit Card Fraud Detection framework using Streamlit and Machine Learning provides an efficient solution 
to this problem. The framework integrates different machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to identify fraudulent transactions accurately.
